<p style="color:#E6C208;">I. <b>Movement</b></p>
<br>
Refers to the distance a character can travel in a single turn. That distance is determined by their <u>Speed</u> stat. Each grade of speed a character has above "E" adds an additional tile to their movement, starting at two(2).
<br>
<br>
Any action performed during a character's turn reduces that character's tile movement by one. <u>Backpedalling</u> refers to any movement made in the opposite direction of a threat or opposition and reduces that character's tile-movement by an additional tile. This reduction however can be negated by <u>Jumping</u>, but comes at the disadvantage of being <u>Airborne</u>.
<br>
<br>
Being <u>Airborne</u> means that a character must respond to any and all threats before they can perform a movement, meaning they <u>cannot</u> perform a <u>Speed-Evasion</u>.
<br>
<br>
When the intent to <u>Chase</u> is clearly present then tiles can be adjusted by the character whom moved first to use unused tiles to follow their specified target after said target moves in response to them being chased.
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p style="color:#E6C208;">II. <b>Taijutsu</b></p>
<br>
<i>Refers to all combat conducted in close-quarters, and is commonly referred to as "CQC".</i>
<br><br>
<p style="color:#E6C208;"><u>Defensive Turns</u></p>
The maximum number of defensive turns a character can have when engaged in close-quarters combat is always three (3).* For every step (+, -) difference in agility a character has one less defensive turn against their attacker. Defensive turns tick down until a character has none left and is struck or they spend a turn not defending.
<br><br>
Eg. Attacker (C) vs (C-) Defender AGI = 2 Defensive Turns<br>
Eg.  Attacker AGI (C) vs (C) Defender AGI = 3 Defensive Turns<br>
Eg; Attacker AGI (C) vs (C+) Defender AGI = 3 Defensive Turns<br>
<br><br>
<i>The exception to this rule is when using an ability (IE. Sharingan) that provides <u>bonus</u> defensive agility. This increases the cap to defensive turns by the <u>bonus</u> amount.</i>
<br><br>
<p style="color:#E6C208;"><u>Body Block</u></p>
To perform a <u>body bloc</u>k a character <u>must be adjacent</u> to the character they wish to body block for <u>before the attack was posted</u>. When performing this said character must take <u>Full Damage</u> and both characters <u>forfeit their movement for that turn</u>.
<br>
<p style="color:#E6C208;"><u>Grapple</u></p>
Instead of performing a strike, a character can choose to perform a grapple, pitting strength against strength. If a grapple is used at the same time as a strike the grapple takes priority over the strike and  <u>roots the two grapplers.</u>
<br>
<p style="color:#E6C208;"><u>Disengage</u></p>
Instead of performing a strike or a grapple, a character can choose to perform a <u>disengage</u>. This has the <u>highest priority</u>, and adds three additional tiles to the disengaging character, ignoring the backpedal debuff. 
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p style="color:#E6C208;"><b>III. <u>Ninjutsu</u></b></p>
<br>
<br>
<i>Refers to as anything that is not genjutsu or taijutsu.</i>
<br>
<br>
<p style="color:#E6C208;"><u>Handseal Speed</u></p>
<br>
Each technique has a number of hand signs written on their card.  Depending on your <u>Handseal Speed perk</u>, you will either perform at, below, or above your baseline handseal speed.
<br>
<br>

  <table style="width: 65%">
<tr><small>
<th><p style="color:#E6C208;">Handsigns</th>
<th><p style="color:#E6C208;">Effect</th>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>+1 Grade</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>2-9</td>
<td>None</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>+10</td>
<td>-1 Grade</td></small></tr>

</table>
<br>
<br>
<p style="color:#E6C208;"><u>Clashing</u><br></p>
Whenever two opposing ninjutsu collide it is considered a <u>Clash</u>. In order to nullify a technique, your technique must be within two(2) steps of the opposing jutsu (eg; D+ vs C). If a technique is a grade or greater power than the difference in steps is the damage of the <u>Breakthrough</u> (eg; D+ vs C+ = D Damage).
<br>
<br>
<i>Modifiers that would not be discernible until impact (eg; DMG, Knockbacks), do  <u>not</u> have to be revealed until two jutsu clash or a jutsu hits an opponent.</i>
<br>
<br>
<p style="color:#E6C208;"><u>Elemental Advantage</u><br></p>
Water Release (水遁, Suiton) has an advantage over Fire Release (火遁, Katon).<br> 
Fire Release (火遁, Katon) has an advantage over Wind Release (風遁, Fūton).<br> 
Wind Release (風遁, Fūton) has an advantage over Earth Release (土遁, Doton).<br> 
Earth Release (土遁, Doton) has an advantage over Water Release (水遁, Suiton).
<br><br>
<i>If an element has an elemental advantage over another then the disadvantaged element is treated as a grade weaker in power when calculating the <u>clash.</u></i>
<br>
<br>
<p style="color:#E6C208;"><u>Breakthrough</u><br></p>
If a character fails to clash a jutsu a <u>breakthrough</u> is achieved. This can only be responded to by having a step higher in speed, a <u>Speed-Evasion</u>, or an <u>Instant Defense</u> technique, otherwise the character is hit by the breakthrough in damage.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p style="color:#E6C208;"><b>IV. Genjutsu</b></p>
<br>
<i>Refers to immaterial illusions, though such illusionist tend to be rare they are very dangerous when encountered.</i>
<br>
<br>
<p style="color:#E6C208;"><u>Resisting</u><br></p>
Before a genjutsu can take full effect a character has the chance to resist it in response. To do so a character <u>forfeits any previous action (if there were any)</u>  and must have equal control to the <u>base</u> power of the genjutsu.*
<br>
<br>
EG; Kabuto vs Itachi & Sasuke
<br>
<br>
Kabuto fires Daibakufu at Itachi
Itachi uses Kasegui
Sasuke uses Goukakyuu at Kabuto
<br>
<br>
Kabuto must <u>cancel</u> his Daibakufu, and treat the Goukakyuu as a <u>breakthrough</u> if he wants to <u>resist</u> Kasegui.
<br>
<br>
<i>The exception to this is if the potential victim's control is a <u>grade greater than the base power</u> of the genjutsu, in which case they do not have to forfeit their previous actions.</i>
<br>
<br>
<p style="color:#E6C208;"><u>Breaking</u><br></p>
Once ensnared in a genjutsu, before a character can attempt to break free, they <u>must first recognize that they are within a genjutsu</u>. Every turn trapped within a genjutsu, the power of said genjutsu decreases by one. Once the control of the victim is equal to the power of the genjutsu they may recognize they are within a Genjutsu and break free by inflicting a <u>Petty Injury</u> such as biting their lip, or breaking their finger.
<br><br>
<i>Any modifiers to a Genjutsu's power that would increase it's difficulty to resist or break do <u>not</u> have to be revealed until the potential victim attempts to do so.</i>
<br>
<br>
Characters not trapped within the Genjutsu can break a person free by inflicting a <u>Light Injury</u> on them.
<br>
<br>
<img src= https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/EaGvISifypntTnon6Ry8EVgYnIPyj8cMy5Ojy5_5H74/https/c.tenor.com/4DDgf1AMrkQAAAAC/genjutsu-naruto.gif>
<br>
<br>
<p style="color:#E6C208;"><b> V. Weaponry</b></p>
<br>
<i>Refers to long-range tools which purpose can range from injuring, interrupting, or inhibiting. These are often a shinobi's first option when entering combat.</i>
<br>
<br>
Once a weapon is thrown a character's agility turns into that thrown weapon's <u>Accuracy</u>. 
<br>
<br>
Evading ranged weapons (ie. Shuriken) require an <u>Agility-Evasion</u>, meaning that agility equal or greater to the accuracy of a weapon is needed to evade. If the evader has one less step in agility than the accuracy of said weapon, a <u>Petty Injury</u> is the maximum damage that can be inflicted. This damage limitation increases for each step difference in agility, allowing for a more "precise" hit.
<br>
<br>
<table style="width: 65%">
<tr><small>
<th><p style="color:#E6C208;">Agility Difference</th>
<th><p style="color:#E6C208;">Damage Limit</th>
<tr>
<td>One Step Difference</td>
<td><p style="color:#808080;"><u>Petty Injury</td></u></tr>
<tr>
<td>Two Step Difference</td>
<td><p style="color:#DAA520;"><u>Light Injury</u></td></small></tr>
</table>
<br>
<br>
Rather than perform an <u>Agility-Evasion</u>, a character can choose to <u>Clash</u> weaponry with weaponry of their own, as long as it is of equal or greater damage, and they are within a step of <u>Accuracy</u>. Alternatively, they can perform a <u>Speed-Evasion</u> as long as their speed is a step above the incoming weapon's accuracy.
